# OCR
This project contains everything in the OCR project (e.g., python code, data, ocr models). The goal of this project is to automatically generate the transliteration of Avestan manuscripts in the XML format provided by the CAB project.

## Directory structure

### data
This folder contains all the data used in this project. Here are the data sources:
1. The CAB project: this project provides images of Avestan manuscripts and the transliteration of some of the pages in XML format.
2. eScriptorium: we use eScriptorium to build training data for the segmentation and recognition models. We upload images (e.g., CAB images), create the segmentation data using eScriptorium graphical tools, add the transliteration (either by transliterating from scratch or by copy-pasting from an existing source like CAB), and then export the data in ALTO XML format. We use the ALTO XML files to train the segmentation and recognition models (using the Makefile commands).

### src
This folder contains all the code developef for this project.
1. `cab`: contains all the code related to CAB project. For example, `cab_xml.py` reads CAB XML output and provides word-level access.
2. `escriptorium`: contains all the code related to eScriptorium. For example, `ocr_text.py` reads OCR text output generated by eScriptorium and provides word-level access.
3. `image`: contains all the code related to image processing. For example, `mirror.py` mirrors an image.
