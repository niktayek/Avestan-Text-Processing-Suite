# Per-witness AB id remapping for misnumbered or shifted segments
# Use witness ids without leading '#'
# ms0400 has multiple section offsets:
# - Y9.2: content shifted by -1 label (what should be 2a is in 2b, 2b in 2c, etc.)
# - Y9.11c-e: shifted by +1 vs lemma
witnesses:
  ms0400:
    # Y9.2 sections: canonical Y9.2a is in ms0400 Y9.2b, etc.
    Y9.2a: Y9.2b
    Y9.2b: Y9.2c
    Y9.2c: Y9.2d
    Y9.2d: Y9.2e
    # Y9.11 sections: canonical Y9.11c is in ms0400 Y9.11d, etc.
    Y9.11c: Y9.11d
    Y9.11d: Y9.11e
    Y9.11e: Y9.11f
