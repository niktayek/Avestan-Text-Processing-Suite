# Witness groups/schools mapping
# Fill in manuscript-to-group assignments here. Groups are arbitrary strings like 'Iranian', 'Indian',
# or finer schools (e.g., 'Kermanian', 'Yazdi', 'Bharaoch'). A witness can belong to multiple groups.
#
# Usage: the annotator will pass the reading's witness groups into the policy so rules can be
# applied conditionally (e.g., trivial in Iranian, meaningful in Indian).
#
# Example:
# groups:
#   Iranian: [ms0005, ms0006, ms0008, ms0015, ms0088]
#   Indian: [ms0677, ms0231, ms0235]
#   Kermanian: [ms0400]
#   Yazdi: [ms0410]
